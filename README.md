## üîç About
This tool helps to check if a website is vulnerable to **clickjacking attacks**. It generates an HTML page embedding the target URL in an iframe. If the website loads successfully, it may be vulnerable.

# üõ°Ô∏è What is Clickjacking?

**Clickjacking** is a type of web attack where an attacker tricks users into clicking something different from what they perceive, potentially leading to unwanted actions. A vulnerable website can be framed (embedded in an invisible iframe) on a malicious site, causing the user to unknowingly interact with the embedded site. This can lead to unintended actions, like changing settings or sharing sensitive information without their knowledge.

Clickjacking often takes advantage of websites that don‚Äôt have proper protections like **X-Frame-Options** headers, which prevent embedding in iframes.

### Example:
When a website is vulnerable, it can be loaded into an invisible frame on another website, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

---

### How to Protect Against Clickjacking:
- Use **X-Frame-Options** HTTP headers with values like `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` to prevent iframe embedding.
- Implement a **Content Security Policy (CSP)** with the `frame-ancestors` directive to control which domains can embed your website.
