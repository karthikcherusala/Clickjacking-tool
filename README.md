## 🔍 About
This tool helps to check if a website is vulnerable to **clickjacking attacks**. It generates an HTML page embedding the target URL in an iframe. If the website loads successfully, it may be vulnerable.

## What is Clickjacking?
Clickjacking is a type of web attack where an attacker tricks users into clicking something different from what they perceive, potentially leading to unwanted actions. A vulnerable website can be framed (embedded in an invisible iframe) on a malicious site, causing the user to unknowingly interact with the embedded site. This can lead to unintended actions, like changing settings or sharing sensitive information without their knowledge.

Clickjacking often takes advantage of websites that don’t have proper protections like X-Frame-Options headers, which prevent embedding in iframes.

Example:
When a website is vulnerable, it can be loaded into an invisible frame on another website, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

##How to Protect Against Clickjacking:
Use X-Frame-Options HTTP headers with values like DENY or SAMEORIGIN to prevent iframe embedding.
Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) with the frame-ancestors directive to control which domains can embed your website.

## 🚀 Features
- Easy-to-use Bash script for Linux systems.
- Checks for clickjacking vulnerabilities by rendering target sites in an iframe.
- Supports popular browsers:
  - Google Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Brave

## 📦 Installation
1. #Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/karthikcherusala/clickjacking-tool.git
   cd clickjacking-tool

2. #Set executable permissions for the script
chmod 755 clickjacking-tester.sh

3.#Copy the script to your desired directory
cp ./clickjacking-tester.sh /home/user/Downloads/

4. # Exit from the current directory
exit

5.# Navigate to the Downloads directory
cd Downloads

6. Run the script:
./clickjacking_tool.sh


Enter the target URL when prompted.

Choose the browser to test the site:

1: Google Chrome
2: Firefox
3: Brave
The tool opens a test page in the selected browser to check for clickjacking.


🔒 How It Works
The tool generates a temporary HTML file (tmp.html) that embeds the target URL inside an iframe. If the iframe loads successfully, it indicates potential vulnerability. The temporary file is deleted after the test.

## ⚠️ Warning
This tool only works without root privileges. Running it with root may cause issues with browser execution.
